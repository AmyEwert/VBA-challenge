# VBA-challenge
Module 2

Citations:
To get started I had a tutoring session that helped me go through the instructions and set up the outline of the code. I worked out from that base-line set-up. If you need to see what we worked on, I can provide that. He sent some of it in slack. I was having hard time understanding him.

From Slack I used the reset code that Andrew Lane shared.

Someone mentioned in class that there was a command "ws.Columns("I:Q").AutoFit" that you could use to auto fit columns. I double checked how to use it in x-pert.

I used x-pert:  
To find the "ThisWorkbook.Worksheets" command using ws variable for all operations and then to loop through all the worksheets.
During debugging I had to look up ".End(xlUp).Row" command to correct typo l vs 1 which is very difficult to see in the default font. I should make a t-shirt saying "the lower case 1" to help me remember to look for things that only look like what you need.
I looked up how to properly use the "&" to concatenate. 

I googled the WorksheetFunction.Match because I have used it in excel before but not VBA. Not sure where I found it but probably somewhere within this site: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/
I've done some reading in there looking for non-specific topics or more info from class.
